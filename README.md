## About The Project
<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many great Winform programs avaiable on GitHub, however I didn't find one that really suit my need so I created this enhanced Winform to access the products and its details of the AdventureWorks2016 database. I want to create a Winform so amazing that it will be the last one y ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time shouldn't be focused on creating queries to get data from a database.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Winform from scratch.
* Now you can get random products from a database with a Winform :smile:

Of course, no one Winform will serve all requeriment since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this Winform!
